## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Advanced Observability**:
  - `on_kernel_event` hook: Enables harness scripts to observe all internal kernel events (Lifecycle, Stream, Audit) in real-time.
  - Flattened serialization for `KernelEvent` to improve Lua ergonomics.
- **First-Class Nesting Support**: 
  - Verified recursive agent spawning via `turin.agent.spawn` with isolated state and harness context.
- **Harness Ergonomics**:
  - Added `prompt` helper to `ContextWrapper` for simplified access and mutation of the last user message.

### Changed
- **Performance & Stability**:
  - Enabled **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)** mode in the Turso/SQLite backend to significantly improve concurrent write performance.
  - Implemented a 5-second busy timeout for database operations to resolve contention during high-frequency event streaming.
  - Refactored harness engine synchronization to use a blocking `std::sync::Mutex`, ensuring guaranteed sequential event capture for "god-view" observers.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Testing Infrastructure**: 
  - Integration tests for the agent loop and harness governance.
  - Property-based testing for path validation using `proptest`.
- **Robust Path Validation**: Introduced a centralized, fuzzed `is_safe_path` utility to prevent traversal attacks.

### Changed
- **Architectural Optimization**: Refactored `Kernel` to use `Arc<TurinConfig>`, significantly reducing cloning overhead.
- **Async I/O**: Switched all file tool metadata calls to async `tokio::fs::metadata`.

### Fixed
- Corrected `session.turn_index` increment logic to include the final turn of a task.


## [0.8.5] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Resilient Hybrid Search (FTS5 + Vector)**:
  - **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**: Implemented state-of-the-art result merging for semantic and keyword search.
  - **Graceful Degradation**: System now handles environments without FTS5 (like standard Turso crate builds) or offline embedding providers without errors.
  - **Tokenized LIKE Fallback**: Introduced a robust "Safety Net" search (Scenario D) that uses tokenized SQL `LIKE` queries when both vector and FTS engines are unavailable, ensuring keyword retrieval always works.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Harness Module System & Hot-Reload**:
  - **Atomic Hot-Reload**: Implemented a "fail-safe" swapping mechanism for harness scripts via a directory watcher (Phase 2) and `/reload` command.
  - **First-Class Module System**: Harness scripts can now `return` tables, enabling clean exported APIs.
  - **turin.import(name)**: New global helper to access exported modules from other scripts.
  - **Prioritized Hook Discovery**: Unified discovery logic that prioritizes hooks in a script's return table over the global environment.
  - **Debounced Watcher**: Added an asynchronous file watcher in the `Kernel` to automatically trigger reloads on script changes with 200ms debouncing.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Named Providers & Multi-Instance Support**:
  - Supported arbitrary naming for provider instances in `turin.toml` (e.g., `[providers.my-fast-client]`).
  - Introduced `type` field in provider configuration to support multiple instances of the same provider kind.
  - Exposed `ctx.provider` setter in Lua `on_before_inference` hook for dynamic, mid-turn switching.
  - Refactored internal `Kernel` and `Harness` logic to resolve clients by their configured string names.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-14

### Changed
- **Capability Normalizer Architecture**:
  - Refactored `ProviderClient` to be provider-agnostic by utilizing the `InferenceProvider` trait from the normalized SDK.
  - Standardized streaming event handling: Turin now consumes a unified `InferenceEvent` stream regardless of the backend (OpenAI or Anthropic).
  - Decoupled inference and embeddings logic: Embeddings are now handled through a dedicated `EmbeddingProvider` abstraction.
  - Simplified kernel-to-provider communication, removing thousands of lines of provider-specific boilerplate and mapping logic.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Adaptive Thinking**:
  - Full support for Anthropic's extended reasoning (Claude 3.7 Sonnet / Opus 4.6).
  - Exposure of `thinking_budget` to the Harness Engine for dynamic reasoning depth control.
- **Cognitive Memory & Anchorage**:
  - Vector search primitives integrated via Turso/SQLite-vec.
  - Automated session summarization and fact anchorage via `on_task_complete` hooks.
- **Multi-Provider Support & Mid-Turn Switching**:
  - Enabled coexistence and switching between Anthropic and OpenAI within the same session.
  - Support for `ctx.provider` overrides in `turin.agent.spawn` and `on_before_inference`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **MCP SDK Support**: Integrated a custom, lightweight Rust-based MCP SDK (`mcp-sdk-rust`) into Turin.
- **Dynamic Tool Loading**:
  - `bridge_mcp` tool: Allows agents to request spawning and connecting to external MCP servers.
  - `McpToolProxy`: Automatically registers tools from MCP servers as native Turin tools.
- **Ecosystem Stability Primitives**:
  - `on_task_complete` hook: Enables harnesses to validate state and re-queue tasks when the queue is exhausted.
  - `turin.context` module: New Lua global module providing `context.glob(pattern)` for safe, workspace-aware file discovery.
- **Internal Stability**:
  - Optimized binary size through LTO and symbol stripping (achieving ~11MB).
  - Hardened `run_task` loop with better error recovery and multi-turn consistency.

### Fixed
- Resolved multiple compilation errors related to borrow checking and brace nesting in the core Kernel.
- Fixed duplicate field declarations in the `Kernel` struct.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Steerable Command Queue**: Added a per-session task queue in the Kernel allowing for persistent, asynchronous steering by humans or harnesses.
- **Interactive REPL**: New `turin repl` command for persistent conversational interaction with the workspace.
- **Task Decomposition Primitives**:
  - `submit_task` tool: Allows agents to propose a multi-step plan.
  - `on_task_submit` hook: Enables harnesses to intercept, approve, reject, or modify agent plans.
- **Verdict::Modify**: Extended the governance system to support data-carrying verdicts. Harnesses can now modify tool arguments (`on_tool_call`) or task lists (`on_task_submit`) on the fly.
- **Steering API**: `session.queue()`, `session.queue_next()`, and `session.clear_queue()` exposed to Lua for active control.

### Changed
- **Kernel Loop**: Refactored the core `run` loop to be queue-driven, supporting multiple sequential tasks within a single persistent session.
- **Harness Engine**: Updated `parse_verdict` to handle `MODIFY` verdict codes and associated JSON data.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **on_before_inference** hook: Enables context engineering and mutation before LLM calls.
- **on_agent_start** hook: Allows harness scripts to initialize state at session startup.
- **Session Globals**: `session.list(limit, offset)` and `session.load(id)` exposed to Lua.
- **Context Globals**: `ctx.summarize()`, `ctx.add_message()`, and `ctx.system_prompt` access.
- **Coding Agent**: Experimental `coding_agent.lua` for automatic `TURIN.md` injection.

### Changed
- **Synchronous Bridge**: Refactored `ctx.summarize` to be synchronous via `block_in_place`, ensuring compatibility with the synchronous Luau VM.
- **Inference Content**: Refactored `InferenceContent::Text` to a struct variant for better `serde` compatibility.
- **Sandboxing**: Enhanced harness loading with per-script environments to prevent global pollution.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Core Engine**: Embedded Luau (mlua) runtime for sandboxed "Governance Harnesses."
- **Persistence**: Turso-backed `StateStore` for atomic event logging, message history, and tool execution tracking.

  - `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file` (safe workspace-restricted access).
  - `shell_exec` (with timeout and output truncation).
- **Governance Primitives**: `on_tool_call` (gating) and `on_token_usage` (budgeting) hooks.
- **CLI**: Interactive streaming UX with `--verbose` for debugging and `--json` for programmatic consumption.
- **SDK Integration**: Native adapters for Anthropic and OpenAI.

### Fixed
- Improved output truncation for large shell results to prevent context window overflows.
- Resolved Luau metatable indexing for property access on Context objects.
